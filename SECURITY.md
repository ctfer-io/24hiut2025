# Reporting Security Issues

This repository contains the challenges for the 24h IUT 2025. These challenges are, by nature, vulnerables. Nevertheless, the vulnerabilities incorporated in the challenges are not subject to Vulnerability Disclosure.

In the case of a vulnerability in a dependency, please refer to the applicable Vulnerability Disclosure practice of the dependency itself.

Thank you for your contribution.
